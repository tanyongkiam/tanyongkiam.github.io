    <b>Positions described below are open as of 1 Mar 2025 and will remain open until filled.</b> <p>

    I am hiring for multiple open PhD student and postdoc positions in formal methods, with a focus on deductive verification and interactive theorem proving across various topics. <p>

    Topics of interest include:
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Trustworthy automated reasoning</b> <p>
        Goal: To build practical, formally verified certification mechanisms and frameworks for automated reasoning tools (see <a href="https://cakeml.org/checkers.html"target="_blank">here</a>). <p>
        Examples: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v38i8.28642" target="_blank">AAAI'24</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-63498-7_24" target="_blank">IJCAR'24 </a><p>
      <li> <b>Verification of (randomized) algorithms</b><p>
        Goal: To formally verify state-of-the-art automated reasoning algorithms, where either the algorithm or the system being analyzed (or both) have probabilistic behavior.<p>
        Examples: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-65627-9_8" target="_blank">CAV'24</a> (distinguished paper award) <p>
      <li> <b>Verification of hybrid systems and control</b><p>
        Goal: To develop and apply logics for control-theoretic reasoning in hybrid systems, and to mechanize these developments in a proof assistant.<p>
        Examples: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3501710.3519541" target="_blank">HSCC'22</a> (best paper and RE award), <a href="http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/2022/abstracts/22-114.html" target="_blank">PhD thesis</a> (distinguished dissertation award) <p>
      <li> <b>Compiler verification and optimization</b><p>
        Goal: To enhance the verified CakeML compiler and associated tools, especially in support of the above goals. <p>
        Examples: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0956796818000229" target="_blank">JFP</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3591266" target="_blank">PLDI'23</a><p>
      <li> I am also interested in formalized mathematics, computer-aided cryptography, and formalization in theoretical computer science.
    </ul>

    <h2> General requirements </h2>
    I am looking to work with students / postdocs with background and research interests in formal methods. <p>
    Candidates with adjacent background, e.g., relevant topics in logic, mathematics, or computer science, are also welcome. <p>

    All positions are fully funded with competitive stipends/salaries. <p>

    They are based in Singapore and require fluency in English. (PhD students have specific requirements, see below) <p>


    Most of the topics will also require working with proof assistants such as Isabelle/HOL, HOL4, and KeYmaera X. Prior experience in interactive proofs is helpful but not mandatory. <p>

    <b> Note: </b> Please feel free to email me for a preliminary chat even if you are unsure of your plans. (PhDs are a long-term commitment!) <p>

    For example, I may be able to offer a (limited) number of shorter-term positions for strong candidates.<p>

    <h2> PhD students </h2>
    Multiple fully-funded PhD student positions are available at the College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. <p>
    Candidates must <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/graduate/radmissionguide" target="_blank">apply</a>
    and be admitted to the NTU CCDS PhD programme, <b>including meeting all of the admission requirements</b>. <p>
    There are two intakes each year (August and January) with respective application deadlines.<p>

    Please email me directly at
    <a href="mailto:tanyongkiam+recruitment@gmail.com">tanyongkiam+recruitment@gmail.com</a>
    for a discussion before you apply.<p>
    Include a CV, a brief description of your academic background (especially any prior research experience), and the research topic(s) you intend to work on for your PhD. <p>
    Other supporting material can be included as needed. <p>
    (Bonus) Pick a recent paper involving formal methods (perhaps even one of mine), write a 1 to 2 page critique of it, and attach it in your email.

    <h2> Postdocs </h2>

    <b>(1 Mar 2025) I am looking for a researcher with background in hybrid/control systems verification. <p>
    Nevertheless, exceptional candidates with relevant background in the above topics will be considered. </b> <p>



    Multiple research scientist positions are available at the Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, Singapore.<p>
    The scientists are expected to work closely with our group based at A*STAR and NTU on the topics above.<p>
    All applicants must have a PhD or be close to graduating with one.<p>
    The PhD degree must be in a relevant field, e.g., Computer Science or Mathematics, and the thesis research must be relevant / adjacent to formal methods. <p>

    Positions are tenable for two years each (with possibility of extension). <p>

    Please email me directly at
    <a href="mailto:tanyongkiam+recruitment@gmail.com">tanyongkiam+recruitment@gmail.com</a>
    for an initial informal discussion.<p>
    It would be helpful if you shared your CV, a brief description of your current research (with pointers to relevant papers), and what you intend to work on as a postdoc with me.
