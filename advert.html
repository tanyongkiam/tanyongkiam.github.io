    </h1>

    I am hiring for multiple open PhD student and postdoc positions in formal methods, with a focus on deductive verification and interactive theorem proving. <p>

    Topics of interest include:
    <ul>
      <li> Trustworthy automated reasoning<p>
        Goal: To build practical, formally verified certification mechanisms and frameworks for automated reasoning tools.<p>
      <li> Verification of (randomized) algorithms<p>
        Goal: To formally verify state-of-the-art automated reasoning algorithms, where either the algorithm or the system being analyzed (or both) have probabilistic behavior.<p>
      <li> Verification of hybrid systems and control<p>
        Goal: To develop and apply logics for control-theoretic reasoning in hybrid systems, and to mechanize these developments in a proof assistant.<p>
      <li> Compiler verification and optimization<p>
        Goal: To enhance the verified CakeML compiler and associated tools, especially in support of the above goals.
      <li> I am also interested in formalized mathematics, computer-aided cryptography, and formalization in theoretical computer science.
    </ul>

    Please also take a look at my <a href="index.html"  target="_blank">home page</a> (publications, tools, etc.) for a detailed sampling of my interests.

    <h2> General requirements </h2>
    I am looking to work with students / postdocs with relevant background and research interests in formal methods. <p>
    Candidates with adjacent background, e.g., in logic, mathematics, or computer science, are also welcome. <p>

    All positions are based in Singapore and require fluency in English. (PhD students have specific requirements, see below) <p>

    Most of the topics will also require working with proof assistants such as Isabelle/HOL, HOL4, and KeYmaera X. Prior experience in interactive proofs is helpful but not mandatory. <p>

    Feel free to email me (commitment-free) for preliminary chats if you are unsure of your plans. <p>

    <h2> PhD students </h2>
    Multiple fully-funded PhD student positions are available at the School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. <p>
    Candidates must <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/graduate/radmissionguide" target="_blank">apply</a>
    and be admitted to the NTU SCSE PhD programme, <b>including meeting all of the admission requirements</b>. <p>
    There are two intakes each year (August and January) with respective application deadlines.<p>

    Please email me directly at
    <a href="mailto:tanyongkiam+recruitment@gmail.com">tanyongkiam+recruitment@gmail.com</a>
    for a discussion before you apply.<p>
    Include a CV, a brief description of your academic background (especially any prior research experience), and the research topic(s) you intend to work on for your PhD. <p>
    Other supporting material can be included as needed. <p>
    (Bonus) Pick a recent paper involving formal methods (perhaps even one of mine), write a 1 to 2 page critique of it, and attach it in your email.

    <h2> Postdocs </h2>
    <b>This is an early advertisement, pending various administrative procedures.</b><p>
    <b>Links to official job advertisement/application pages will be made available around mid to late 2024.</b> <p>

    Multiple research scientist positions will be available at the Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, Singapore.<p>
    The scientists are expected to work closely with our group based at A*STAR and NTU on the topics above.<p>
    All applicants must have a PhD or be close to graduating with one.<p>
    The PhD degree must be in a relevant field, e.g., Computer Science or Mathematics, and the thesis research must be relevant / adjacent to formal methods. <p>

    The positions are tenable for up two years each.

    Please email me directly at
    <a href="mailto:tanyongkiam+recruitment@gmail.com">tanyongkiam+recruitment@gmail.com</a>
    for an initial informal discussion.<p>
    It would be helpful if you shared your CV, a brief description of your current research (with pointers to relevant papers), and what you intend to work on as a postdoc with me.
